# Operation: Who am I?
Latina and Texan. A walking contradiction. A feminist who loves men and wants everyone to be free and happy to live their lives as they choose so long as they don't infringe on someone else's rights. Simply a person trying to make a difference in the world. A little bit of save the world and lead the revolution in me.

My goal as an author is to make a difference in the world. Inspire someone to become who they are and to feel free to show the world.

I am okay with it if the only person I save is myself.
