I am a great fan of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. This is the second of her books that I’ve read, with the first being Purple Hibiscus. I think that what strikes me the most about Adichie is her ability to make the reader empathize with the characters. I loved Ifemelu and I just wanted her to be happy. I was so upset after reading everything and discovering the reason why she and Obinze broke up.

I liked that she was so political in this book. I loved her depiction of the different experiences of the immigrant. Some can be relatively successful like Ifemelu was with her blog. She got to sell it and make a profit from it. She was able to get on her own two feet after years of struggle.

Obinze, on the other hand, had a failed immigrant experience in London after being rejected by the United States. He gets deported and he restarts his life in Nigeria and ends up married and with a wife and child.

She addresses racism in a way that is pretty relevant to 21st century culture. She talks about the distinction between African Americans and Africans. She discusses the different ideas regarding racial distinctions and joins the natural hair movement because of how black women’s hair is deemed unprofessional in work environments. She discusses how her cousin isn’t given sunscreen by his teacher because of the color of his skin.
I think this book is eye opening. Although I don’t necessarily agree with the way Ifemelu and Obinze got together (he did cheat after all), I am really glad that they are on the way to being their happiest selves.
