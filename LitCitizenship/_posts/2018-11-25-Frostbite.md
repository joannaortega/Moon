There are always moments when you read certain books that will shock you. Though I never read any of the Game of Thrones or really, any of George R.R. Martin’s works, I imagine that Richelle Mead became that for Frostbite. Frostbite is that type of book that makes you scream and cry and sob and then gives you a little bit of comfort.

The book opens with Rose and Dimitri going off to get Rose tested for a preliminary exam with a legendary guardian. When they arrive, they realize that everyone has been killed by Strigoi, and slowly, overtime, there is an increase in Strigoi attacks. With winter break approaching, Dimitri allows Rose to practice with an actual stake. She becomes jealous when she meets Dimitri’s friend and Christian’s Aunt Tasha, another strong female character. She offers Dimitri a romantic relationship, which he ultimately denies because of his feelings for Rose. Based on this book, I like Tasha. She is another strong female character who protects Christian after his parents turned Strigoi. She learns some self defense and would like for the Moroi, vampires with a higher social standings, to fight with the dhampirs against the Strigoi.  

Another strong character that is introduced in this book is Rose’s mother, Janine Hathaway. She is widely respected for her ability as a guardian. Though she is even criticized by Rose for being an absentee parent as many women in the world are when they pursue a career, eventually we come to realize (and so does Rose) that Janine wasn’t a terrible mother, simply a mother that did what any man would do, without the stigma that accompanies a typical working mother. She did the best she could by Rose, and in the end, everyone realizes that was the best choice.

Anyways, in this book, Rose, Christian, Mia, and Mason end up in a Strigoi lair, which the latter two go hunting for after the series of killings. This is the first instance in the book where we see Moroi, more specifically Christian and Mia, fighting alongside dhampirs by using their elemental powers. Unfortunately, in this fight, Mason dies and although Rose kills the two Strigoi responsible for it, she becomes marred forever over the experience. She feels guilt over Mason’s feelings for her. It is the parallel to her and Dimitri’s feelings for one another. If she wants to pursue the career of her dreams, which is to guard Vasilisa, she cannot act on her feelings for Dimitri and neither can he. Their responsibility to her best friend is the greatest challenge they have. It’s heartbreaking when responsibility takes over following your heart.
