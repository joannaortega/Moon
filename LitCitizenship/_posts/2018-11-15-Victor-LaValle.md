Victor LaValle was a guest of honor at Texas A&M's Frankenreads event, honoring Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, introducing his new graphic novel, Destroyer.

LaValle offered great insight on the origins of his book. His inspiration was Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Shelley's Frankenstein has been interpreted by many as mainly a story about God vs. Science. LaValle notes how it is truly a very political book that has two versions: Mary Shelley's version and Percy Shelley's version.  Mary Shelley's book was originally more sympathetic to the monster, who rejects humanity, and acknowledges Victor's failure of power. Percy Shelley changed the book to make it more sympathetic to Victor, the man in power who is feeling constantly tormented and pursued, with humanity rejecting his monster. Victor is not taking responsibility for his failure.

Destroyer was born out of the Black Lives Matter and police brutality movement and LaValle's questioning if humans should even exist. It acknowledges the idea of individual versus collective. In LaValle's Destroyer, some of the characters blame all people for the failure of humanity. He didn't distinguish between both good and bad people because doing so allows for certain groups to be protected and distanced from the problem. All humanity is to be blamed.

LaValle created Victor Frankenstein to be a strong, African-American mother, a nanotech genius who has lost her son due to a police shooting. She loves him so much, she brings him back to life, and her son becomes the face of hope who encourages the idea that humans are still good despite his life ending the way it did.

Though the message that LaValle is sending into the world resonated with me, as writers, he noted that writers do not get to decide whether or not their book or work is political because it will be political. The responsibility of writers is to make sure what message the work is putting forth in the world.

Victor LaValle, Columbia professor, is an eloquent and mind-expanding speaker and author. His graphic novel, Victor LaValle's Destroyer is out now! Available through Amazon and Target.
