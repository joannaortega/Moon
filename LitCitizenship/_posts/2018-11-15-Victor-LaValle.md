Victor LaValle talked at Texas A&M's Frankenreads event about his comic Destroyer.

He discussed the origins of his book. His inspiration was Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. He discussed how many people interpreted the book as a God vs. Science story. It is a very political book that has two versions: Mary Shelley's whose book is more sympathetic to the monster, who rejects humanity and acknowledges Victor's failure of power. Percy Shelley changed the book to make it more sympathetic to Victor.

Destroyer was born out of the Black Lives Matter and police brutality movement and LaValle's questioning if humans should even exist. It acknowledges the idea of individual vs collective. In LaValle's Destroyer, he blames all people for the failure of humanity. He didn't distinguish between both good and bad people. All humanity is to be blamed.

He portrayed Victor as a strong, African-American mother, who happens to be a nanotech genius, who has lost her son due to a police shooting. She brings him back and her son becomes the face of hope, the idea that humans are still good.

What resonated with me the most about LaValle was when he pointed out that you don't get to decide whether or not your book or work is political. Your work will be political. From that point, it is up to you to make sure what message you are putting forth in the world.

I found LaValle to be an eloquent and mind-expanding speaker and author. He is very inspirational as well.

Victor LaValle's Destroyer is out now! Available through Amazon and Target.
