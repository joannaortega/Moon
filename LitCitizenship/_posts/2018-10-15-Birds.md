I spotted this blackbird on my friend’s wall when I visited her on Friday. I’d seen it many times before when I’d visited her at her different dormitories. I hadn’t seen it nor her in a long time though and it felt a bit like a makeshift homecoming.

Looking at the painting, I liked the colors. I noticed the blues and the purples and the reds over the black, almost like an aurora borealis. I liked the different colors of the dots. Most of all, I liked the lyrics that she added to the canvas, in the same contrasting white color as the blackbird outline.

Blackbird by The Beatles. It’s one of my favorite songs. Although I know in reality it’s about the oppression of Africans and African Americans, I interpret the song in many different ways. Some days, it’s about freedom, as birds typically represent freedom in literature. Other days, it’s about eventually recognizing and reaching your own potential. The calming and soothing tones of the song help me when I’m upset or insecure or in search of peace, just as bird watching or bird noticing makes me feel.

And sometimes it’s about when it’s time to fight. When it’s time to stand up to injustice and fight for freedom. Whether we are jailed in our own minds or by others, tortured, beaten, and broken, when the time comes,

“Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise”
