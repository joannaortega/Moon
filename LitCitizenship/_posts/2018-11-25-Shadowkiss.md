If there was ever a book to break my heart to a thousand shiny pieces, it’s this one.

Rose is amazing. And so is Richelle Mead for writing this and for having that hindsight and foresight 20/20 vision. Everything has a solution. Everything is foreshadowed, but you don’t realize the true brilliance until you go back and read the book again.

The whole concept of being shadow kissed is brilliant, really. The closer you get to death, the more connected you are to it? And it comes with superpowers? Seeing ghosts who tell you and give you symptoms when Strigoi are near? As a guardian, that’s like a wand to a wizard, or something else that’s really convenient. Her killing Strigoi allowed her to see Mason, who does his best to warn her of the weakening wards because the upper class Moroi decide their social standing is more important than their safety. She can be one of the few to warn others when Strigoi are approaching.

The bond between Vasilisa and Rose gets interesting. They realize that Lissa’s magic comes from herself, so there is a darkness and unbalance her own magic produces. Rose is the person that absorbs that darkness through their bond. It brings a complication to their relationship. Rose doesn’t want to deny her friend anything, not her magic or the best protection (Dimitri and Rose), and she has a hard time dealing with both factors, ultimately creating a rift in their friendship, leading to a separation.

Part of what led me to feel such strong emotions, aside from the ending interaction between Vasilisa and Rose is the fact that Dimitri and Rose finally got together. Throughout the series, he has been very supportive of her and everything she is, including when they don’t understand what is going on with Rose regarding the ghosts. It depicts a truly healthy relationship. Their relationship isn’t even idealistic or perfect; in fact, it’s a forbidden relationship on many different levels (age, teacher-student relationship, both guardians of the same Moroi, etc). They argue and have real problems they work through. But they love each other, support, are there for one another despite the craziness that goes on in this book. I felt such a high and deep feeling of joy after reading this.

And then Richelle Mead shattered me. A Strigoi attack happens. Moroi and dhampirs fight together in the fight at school and in the rescue mission and while we see this socially revolutionary idea developing and taking stride, the high continues. But then Dimitri is turned into a Strigoi, and the high I had was crushed. It broke my heart and tore me apart. After the high of them sleeping together and cementing their relationship, he was gone. He was worse than dead--he was Strigoi, something that in the first book we understand is a form he would never want to be.

And Rose is left in the crossroads of something I think that no one has ever wanted to truly choose from: their best friend or their boyfriend.
