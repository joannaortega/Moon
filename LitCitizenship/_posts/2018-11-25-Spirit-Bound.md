This book is full of hope. We all have hope that Rose will get Dimitri back. Lissa and Rose go off on another adventure to save him after she graduates, despite Rose’s relationship with Adrian.

Rose, Lissa, and Eddie go on their way to break Lissa’s Uncle Victor out of his high security Tarasov prison in order to save Dimitri. Victor reminds me of Hannibal Lecter in the sense that he is smart and cunning. He does things in a twisted way, as shown in the first book when he makes Lissa heal him simply so he would live and carry out a vision for the world to be vastly different from what it had become.

In a way, I admire Victor for that. He had radical ways, sure, but old as he was, he didn’t view the Moroi as a group that needed intense protection. He saw them as a group that had taken a backseat to where they needed to be: alongside the fight against the Strigoi with the dhampirs. He thought magic should be used for the offensive rather than simply being parlor tricks. I wholeheartedly agree. The politics in the book force dhampirs to be guardians and if they stray, they become blacklisted.
No only that, in this book, Queen Victoria changes the age that dhampirs go down to the field and active guardianship was from age 18 to 16, enraging the rest of the dhampir community, yet proving Victor’s point. Anyways, Victor is a key point to restoring Dimitri. He knows the most about spirit users as his brother was one. So Lissa is the only one that can save him by staking him.

Needless to say, the sisterhood comes through, and Dimitri goes back to being a dhampir, thanks to Lissa. Due to guilt of what he did to Rose while they were in Siberia and all the people he harmed while he was a Strigoi, he pushes Rose away. He doesn’t think he can love again. He doesn’t think he can do anything to redeem himself despite how much both Lissa and Rose try to convince him. Yet, deeply ingrained, he is reactive when Rose is in danger. He would still do anything for her, especially when the palace guards arrest her.

Maybe there are still some feelings there.
