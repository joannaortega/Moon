I like Austin Kleon’s work. He discusses how to become a well-rounded author. He goes into some of the struggles most aspiring writers undergo. One of those things is when people, like myself, look at pieces of literature and art and think that their own work will never compare because their ideas aren’t as good. Those authors or artists we admire can influence our work just as they had authors and artists influence them. There may be parts of their work that stick with you and may become parts of your new creative work.

Something else that stuck with me was when Kleon talks about not being ashamed of your “trash” and the things you like. I love reading books with cheesy love stories or female-centered journeys. I remember that people called them cheap and used other negative descriptions, and I didn’t defend the literature I loved out of shame. I should have defended both parts of me. If I can’t defend that in my life, then I can’t defend my writing, nor will I be able to sell my writing after rejections.

However, the quote that really stuck with me was when Kleon says, “But who you know is largely dependent on who you are and what you do, and the people who know can’t do anything for you if you’re not doing good work.” When you are in college or even out of college and trying to get a job or trying to publish, many people claim that you can’t even get a foot through the door unless you know someone. However, Kleon emphasizes that what is most important is to perfect your craft and do the best work you can. People won’t recommend someone and put their name on the line when it is someone they know can’t handle the job or is producing crap work. If you give the person you are trying to impress less reasons for them not to hire you or accept your book, then they are more likely to hire or publish your book. It’s better to have a good product and have great work to show proof of your worth rather than rely on someone else’s word of mouth.
