This was probably my least favorite book out of the series. It’s not because it’s not a good book, I just like reading about the real Dimitri’s relationship with Rose, so I am heavily biased. There is so much pain and so much emotion. For me, this was no winning in this book in any way I saw it. Dimitri was either going to die or continue being Strigoi. Both were less than ideal solutions for the individual we’d grown to love earlier.
Rose finds her independence and puts her needs first, over her friendship or guardianship of Lissa, by going to hunt Dimitri.

I liked the people she meets. Sydney was introduced in this book as an alchemist, a human who knows about the vampire world and helps keep it hidden. She is such a knowledgeable person who knows multiple languages and is a car aficionado. Sydney shows that intelligent people who are specifically book smart can have different skills. They aren’t limited to what is between the pages.

I think one of the best parts of this book was the amount of strong-willed women or women of power. Galina is in charge of the powerful Strigoi organization Dimitri is a part of. Avery, a spirit user with multiple shadow-kissed to two people, is a powerful woman who is able to manipulate multiple people at a time, including other spirit users like Lissa and Adrian for their powers. We meet Dimitri’s family, all filled with strong willed sisters, his mother, and his scary and powerful grandmother.  

The fight between Dimitri and Rose was heartbreaking. It brought to mind the fight she had with him while she was still in the academy. She fails at killing him while it nearly kills her. He captures her after she hesitates to kill him and the next time she tries, he somehow survives.  

And we are left with hope that our Dimitri may come back.
