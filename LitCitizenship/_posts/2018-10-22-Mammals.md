Along the road walked my favorite mammal.

No. Not humans in general.

Just this one.

In a crayon box, he's yellow. The brightest and most brilliant human I've ever had the pleasure of sharing tea and broccoli and cheddar soup in bread bowls with. He's sweet and has a strong, sturdy shoulder to cry on. He smells like warmth.

He's a feminist. The manliest man I've ever met, so secure in who he is and believes in the rights of everyone to be happy. He's logical and rational and can build universes.

He's already a walking revolutionary. A higher evolutionary creation. He views the world in a different way, and he sees the different potential in everything. New ideas pop into his mind--it seems like at a rate of a thousand thoughts per hour. He's sure to change the world around him.

I know he's changed mine. One single mammal, shorter than 6 feet tall, got me questioning my ideologies and my beliefs after sitting next to me and talking for an hour. Why do I believe what I believe if it's not aligned with my other ideologies or beliefs?

He's one of my closest and dearest friends and I am so lucky to have him in my life.
