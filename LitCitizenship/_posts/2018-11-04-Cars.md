In this car, I learned how to drive. In this car, I underwent many successes and very many failures. I had my ups and downs, and believe me, there have been many downs.

Cars are synonymous basically to driving. And for so long, I had no interest in driving. To tell you the truth, I don't enjoy driving. I think there are many people that shouldn't be on the road that are. I used to consider myself one of those people...now I only think it some of the time.  

Especially in college towns, some drivers are very reckless. They forget to use their blinkers. They merge without truly measuring for safe space. They don't merge to lanes completely so their backs are sticking out and people have to swerve to get out of the way. I won't get started on distracted driving. That's another rabbit hole I could rant about.  

My first time being behind the wheel, there was a light drizzle. My mom was in the passenger seat. I drove from my aunt's house to my house, and I was so nervous. My goal was for nothing and no one to get hurt. I didn't want to crash, and Texas drivers give me anxiety.

The anxiety has somewhat lessened. There are moments when I still get sucked back. I can't say I love driving. But I love the freedom and independence, and that's something I wouldn't give up for anything in the world.
