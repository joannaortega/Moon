Before I start down the rabbit hole of raving about the following series, I just want to say that this is my favorite book series. Richelle Mead’s Vampire Academy series inspired me to want to write and to learn Russian.

This book is the first in the series, and from the moment I read it, it captivated my attention. It is vastly different from other vampire books like Twilight. First of all, the main protagonists are strong, special females. Vasilisa Dragomir, a Moroi vampire who drinks blood,can bring people back to life and can heal others with her specialization, which we later find out is known as spirit. Rosemary Hathaway, a vampire-human hybrid known as a dhampir, is a kickass guardian-in-training who kept Vasilisa safe during their year outside of the school. Though there are love interests for the girls, the book focuses mainly on their friendship and sisterhood to one another, which is important.

It’s important for young girls to have access to stories where the protagonists are females, who stay true to who they are and find strength within themselves. Vasilisa is very intelligent. Rose is athletically talented. They are both able to catch up and surpass their classmates in their respective specialties, despite their years outside of St. Vladimir’s. Women helping and supporting other women should be portrayed more in the media, and Richelle Mead does such a great job in doing so in this book. Both girls are willing to protect each other through everything, whether it’s damaged reputations or being stalked by people that are trying to take advantage of their powers.

Dimitri Belikov was the other part of the book that captivated me. To be fair, anyone described as a god and who has killed six Strigoi (evil vampires who kill when they feed) has my respect. Joking aside, he sees Rose as someone more than a screw up. He sees her potential, her immense sense of responsibility, her goodness...it’s why he falls for her. He is also someone that values protecting Lissa after being assigned to her. It’s that passion that he and Rose share. It’s what makes them powerful and dangerous.

Most of all, it’s what makes me love this book.
