The Grayer, The Better

I like clouds. There's a whole science behind them, classifying them based on shape and purpose.

Personally, I like the dark ones. I love the ones that cover up the whole sky, angry and aggressive. I love the ones that stop the sun from fully blasting you in the face. Especially on hot game days, I prefer clouds. They prevent blistering sunburns.  

And I love the deep, big, gray clouds that lead to rain. A deep rain, that splatters and taps on your apartment window or car windshield. I love to get a hot mug of cocoa or chai and just gaze out the window in sweats.

I don't always love being under the rain. I especially hate it when I have expensive belongings in my possession. But when I don't, and I have rain boots on, I love jumping in puddles and dancing in the rain. It makes me feel alive, carefree, and blissful.

Clouds are...different. Like people. They have different shapes and colors. And they really are all special and beautiful, and they all serve a purpose.
