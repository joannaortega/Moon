At the risk of sounding like I'm exaggerating, I just want to say that Dan Pena came to the classroom to talk at just the right time. I want be an author. I want to write. Yet, it seemed like such an irrealistic and impossible dream. It was a complicated dream.

He assuaged some of those fears for me. My dreams in the deep air were somehow now a bit more grounded as he talked about his own experiences publishing his book.

What a great book it is as well! As a person, he was sweet and passionate and open. He was very real, very human, not leaping on some sixth level arrogance that I've experienced. His writing had very detailed and beautiful imagery. We felt with his characters. I felt with Lalo, who was in pain and dying. I felt with Cuauhtemoc, who was becoming someone else due to this experience. I felt like I needed to hug all of these characters to keep their humanity present. I think that's what makes him a strong writer. He makes you feel and empathize. He makes you believe. Best of all, I got to read some Latino literature that accurately portrays real people, especially real women. 

Read Bang! today. You won't regret it.
