I like Steal Like An Artist. Kleon uses this book to teach people how to create bodies of work, and it is particularly helpful when you don’t really understand how to get inspired. As Kleon points out, we are built from our influences. It’s okay to take inspiration from many sources. Simply don’t plagiarize and get inspiration from multiple artists. Don’t shy away from the inspiration other works may give you because better readers are usually better writers. What you create will be new and better because it is something transformed by your hand.

Also, his note to write the book you want to read is actually quite brilliant advice. There are a lot of people that just focus on the hypothetical of what may be a great bestseller or may be assuredly published. But a lot of people forget that there is true pleasure in creating art. You may be writing or creating what someone else needs to see or read.

Also its very important to have side hobbies and jobs. I think this applies to real life wherever you are. Sometimes your life’s dream won’t pan out. It’s better to have a stable job. Also, your life can’t just be about your project. When you are focused on the stuff you are doing, you can get tunnel vision or you can get stuck, the way we all understand. Kleon does a great job in explaining that distractions can make you better at writing.
