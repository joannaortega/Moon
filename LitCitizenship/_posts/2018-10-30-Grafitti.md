Had I gone to Houston, I would have taken a picture of the Be Someone grafitti. It is a stunning art form I will never be able to fully appreciate.

This has been by far the hardest observation I've had to take a picture for. In College Station, everyone is so respectful of property. I went to multiple stalls in restrooms and looked at and under desks. I looked at cement and trees for names and signatures of love. I found no secret messages. I found no hearts carved. And though I appreciate the fact that Aggies wouldn't deface public property and nature, I couldn't help but feel a tiny bit disappointed.

It took a train crossing in front of my bus to see the rainbow of colors. Once I heard the horn blow, I pulled out my camera because I knew a thousand signatures were about to pass me by, and I was right. A thousand little rebels, breaking the rules for no particular clear purpose other than to get their name out. Maybe to spread their own little art to the world.

I grew up on Banksy. A rebel in his own light. Leading his own revolution in the way he knows how to. Anonymous. Unknown. And yet, he rides at midnight with every step, every art piece being stronger in message and harder in beauty.

It's inspiring, really.
