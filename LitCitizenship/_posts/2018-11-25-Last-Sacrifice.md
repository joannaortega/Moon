Rose has been imprisoned due to the murder of the queen and the evidence is stacked against her. Thanks to her support system consisting of her parents and friends, she gets broken out of prison as a runaway with Dimitri and eventually Sydney.

I love this book for all of the character development. I love the way Dimitri goes through his own personal PTSD therapy within himself and with Strigoi turned Moroi, Sonya Karp, Rose’s teacher. He finally admits his emotions to himself. He rises from being a broken alive shell to a living person that actually has feelings and is willing to act on them, like when he and Rose get together again.

Lissa becomes queen with poise and grace. She runs to distract from Rose’s escape, and while she is very nervous and anxious and against it at the beginning, she eventually believed in herself and her ability. She becomes this figure of a revolution and revolutionary thought. It was so magnificent to see her finally get to who she’s supposed to be and she gets to enact that role as Lissa’s secret sibling is revealed and she gets her rights as a reigning family.  

As for Rose, she understands that she has a responsibility to Lissa most of all. She places all of her energy in finding the lost Dragomir relative, which was insanely shocking when Mead finally revealed who she was. Not only that, Rose physically defends Lissa when Tasha shoots at her after it’s revealed that she is the one that murdered Tatiana. She almost died in the emergency room and was freed from her bond to Lissa.

While some people can say that this book has all of the expected endings, I think that anything else wouldn't have been true to Mead's actual writing or the tropes of the genre. Genres aren't awful things.
