I traveled by this flashing sign for the first time on a motorcycle with my dear friend. I’d driven past it multiple times and really thought nothing of it, simply considering it one more pause closer to home. Riding on his beautiful red motorcycle with my hands on his waist for support, he told me that he absolutely detested the sign.

“What purpose does this stop sign serve?” he asked. “It makes no sense! And you have them everywhere in Texas!” He pulled forward after the car in front of us crossed forward.

I laughed at his frustration. “What is your opinion on this stop sign?” I asked him in return. He chuckled and reached back to pat my leg before driving forward.

I went back to that stop sign on Friday. I parked on a street nearby, and as I walked, I noticed the recreational center with crowds of families and justified that as the reason for the flashing stop signs. But that wasn’t the focus of my attention. It wasn’t even the long green grass or how heavily transited this road was. It was the tiny Phoenix street sign.

I identify with the Phoenix. In life, I’ve fallen and died time and time again. With each rebirth, I get back up stronger and wiser. After seeing it on tattoos and apps, there it was again. Another sign of another rebirth. It was time for another beginning.

I walked back to my car a little lighter and went home.
