Please keep reading to the end. Don’t let the next sentence shut you off.

I am a raging feminist. No, I don’t hate men. Quite the contrary, actually, I happen to love men. I love when the men in my life succeed. I love to kiss men and hug men and spoon with men.

I am a feminist because I believe in choice. I believe people have the choice to do whatever the hell they want so long as it isn’t infringing on the rights of anyone else. I think that men should be free to wear whatever societal gendered clothes they want, just as women do. I think women, if they so choose to, should be allowed to do things that may be considered man’s work or man’s labor.

Do I believe in equal pay? Hell yeah I do. If it’s the same job, same experience, same effort, why the hell not? Equality, dude. A woman gets paid less and in this day in age, we can’t rely on old social constructs. Women don’t eat, keep warm, or shower with air. We have bills. We have responsibilities just like men do. Not only that, single mothers with dependent children have to make their limited check stretch. I am in no way trying to imply that single fathers don’t have difficulties like women. But this isn’t an even playing field.

If women have children, the child is a distraction and a priority over work and they won’t be a dedicated employee. When has that ever deterred the hiring of a man? More than that, why should it matter for either gender?

I am a feminist because without my foremothers (is this the correct term? Eh. I’m going with it.), I wouldn’t have an education or the right to vote or even have the opportunity to communicate my ideas through this blog. Women wouldn’t be in office or have jobs or have a chance to be independent and fall in love with whatever they want to do or whoever they want.

I hope that people won’t be turned off by the connotation. Feminism has become a dirty word, laden with implications that are inaccurate for most of the women I know. We just want a safe environment for ourselves and for future generations. We want people to feel free and open to discuss what they are and why they feel the way they do.  

I believe that people have the right to do what they want to get to where they want to be in life (again, so long as they aren’t hurting anyone by doing it). I want to be happy, y’all. And I feel like if we all strive to just be happy with ourselves, never mind what others are doing that we don’t necessarily agree with, the world may become a better place.
